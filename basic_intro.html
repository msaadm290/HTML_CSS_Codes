<!-- HTML Basic

In this chapter we will show some basic HTML examples.

Don't worry if we use tags you have not learned about yet.

HTML Documents

All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>.

The HTML document itself begins with <html> and ends with </html>.

The visible part of the HTML document is between <body> and </body>. -->

<!-- Example  -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
    
<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

<!-- HTML Headings -->

<!-- HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags. -->

<!-- <h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading:  -->

<!-- Example -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<h3>This is heading 3</h3>
<h4>This is heading 4</h4>
<h5>This is heading 5</h5>
<h6>This is heading 6</h6>

<!-- The link's destination is specified in the href attribute. 

Attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements. -->

<!-- HTML Paragraphs
HTML paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag: -->

<!-- Example -->
   
<p>This is a paragraph..</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>


<!-- HTML Images -->

<!-- HTML images are defined with the <img> tag.

The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, 
and height are provided as attributes: -->


<!-- Example -->

<img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="w3Schools.com" width="104"
height="142">

<!-- View HTML Source Code:
Click CTRL + U in an HTML page, 
or right-click on the page and 
select "View Page Source". 
This will open a new tab containing the HTML source code of the page. -->

</body>
</html>
