<!-- HTML Entities -->
<!-- Some characters are reserved in HTML.

If you use the less than (<) or greater than (>) signs in your HTML text, the browser might mix them with tags.

Entity names or entity numbers can be used to display reserved HTML characters.

Entity names look like this: -->

<!-- &entity_name; -->

<!-- Entity numbers look like this: -->

<!-- &#entity_number; -->

<!-- To display a less than sign (<) we must write: &lt; or &#60;

Entity names are easier to remember than entity numbers.-->
