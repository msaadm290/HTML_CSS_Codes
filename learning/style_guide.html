<!-- Always Declare Document Type
Always declare the document type as the first line in your document.

The correct document type for HTML is: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- Use Lowercase Element Names -->

<!-- HTML allows mixing uppercase and lowercase letters in element names.

However, we recommend using lowercase element names, because:

Mixing uppercase and lowercase names looks bad
Developers normally use lowercase names
Lowercase looks cleaner
Lowercase is easier to write -->

<!-- Always Quote Attribute Values
HTML allows attribute values without quotes.

However, we recommend quoting attribute values, because:

Developers normally quote attribute values
Quoted values are easier to read
You MUST use quotes if the value contains spaces -->

<table class="striped"></table>

<body>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    </body>
